## Star Trek Chatbot: Final Project for Alura's AI Immersion

This project implements a small intelligent assistant chatbot inspired by Star Trek. It leverages natural language processing techniques to provide informative and engaging responses to user queries.

### Project Overview

The core functionality of the chatbot revolves around the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - A DataFrame is constructed containing information about Star Trek episodes.
   - Textual data within the DataFrame undergoes embedding, a process that transforms text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.

2. **User Interaction:**
   - Users submit queries related to Star Trek episodes.

3. **Response Generation:**
   - The chatbot retrieves relevant information from the embedded DataFrame based on the user's query.
   - The retrieved data is then transformed into a user-friendly response, incorporating natural language elements.

**This project serves as the final requirement for Alura's AI Immersion.**

### Technologies Used

- Python (programming language)
   - Pandas (data manipulation library)
   - NumPy (numerical computing library)
- Natural language processing (NLP) techniques (for text embedding and processing)

### Getting Started in Google Colab

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Familiarity with Python programming and basic NLP concepts is beneficial.

2. **Open Google Colab:**
   - Browse to [colab.research.google.com](colab.research.google.com).

3. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Click on "File" -> "New" -> "Notebook from GitHub URL."
   - In the pop-up window, paste the URL of your GitHub repository for this project (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/star-trek-chatbot.git`).
   - Click "Open notebook."

4. **Run the Notebook Cells:**
   - Click the "Run" button (triangle symbol) next to each code cell (block of code) to execute them sequentially.

5. **Interaction:**
   - The code will handle data preparation and potentially prompt you for user input (depending on the implementation).
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook cells to interact with the chatbot.

### Future Enhancements

- Expand the chatbot's knowledge base to incorporate additional Star Trek information beyond episodes.
- Implement more sophisticated NLP techniques for advanced query understanding and response generation.
- Integrate a user interface for a more interactive experience.
